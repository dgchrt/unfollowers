# unfollowers
Find out who your unfollowers are

## How it works
This program will ask for your list of followers and following from a prominent picture-focused Internet forum, then display who's not following you back. Please open your profile on your browser, open each list when asked, scroll down to load the whole list, select all (Ctrl+A), copy (Ctrl+C) and paste (Shift+Ctrl+V), then hit Enter twice after pasting the content to proceed.

## Dependencies
You need a terminal emulator and a Python 3 interpreter. These will be most likely already installed on your system, but there is a `.tool-versions` file for your convenience, in case you have [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)

## Usage
Simply clone this repository, then run the tool locally. The CLI will tell you what to do next.
